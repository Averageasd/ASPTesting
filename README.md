# ASP.NET Testing Demo

## About
Project that I learnt about unit and integration testing. In Unit tests, we mock the injected modules so that we can test the module we want to test in isolation. Then we have integration testing where we use fake data and simulate http calls to make sure all parts work together correctly.
