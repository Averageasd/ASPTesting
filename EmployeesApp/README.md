# Sample asp.net api with tests


## About
Project where I got my hands dirty with unit testings and integration testings. I gained a deeper understanding of various concepts 
such as Setup, Mock, Assert. I also learnt how to mock database and test results with fake data. I learnt that mocking helps us test each
module individually as we can set up custom behaviors for injected modules.
